Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a final-year engineering student passionate about technology and problem-solving. Currently, I'm seeking an engineering internship to apply and expand my skills in a professional setting.

In my free time, I love diving into personal development projects, exploring new technologies, and honing my technical expertise. Iâ€™m particularly fascinated by artificial intelligence and its potential to shape the future, and I enjoy experimenting with AI tools and frameworks in my projects.

Now, with a solid technical foundation and growing confidence, I'm excited to share my work and ideas with the GitHub community. Letâ€™s build something amazing together! ðŸš€
